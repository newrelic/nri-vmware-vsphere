# New Relic VMware vShpere integration

[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nri-vsphere/badge.svg?targetFile=vendor/vendor.json)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nri-vsphere?targetFile=vendor/vendor.json)

New Relic's VMware vShpere integration captures critical summary and performance metrics data by connecting to VMware vCenter or an ESXi Host. For more information, see [the official New Relic docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration).

The integration collects data about data centers, clusters, virtual machines, hosts, datastores, resource pools, and networks. In addition to metrics, the integration can also capture vSphere events and VM snapshot information when enabled by the appropriate flags.

## Requirements

- [New Relic Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 or higher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure)
- New Relic Infrastructure Pro subscription or trial

## Installation

To install the integration, follow the official [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/vmware-vsphere-monitoring-integration). We recommend using your operating system's package manager.

## Getting started

After you've [installed](#installation) the integration make sure that you have the required configuration for your environment.

To configure the integration go to `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/` (Linux) or `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\` (Windows) and open the`vpshere-config.yml` configuration file.

Configure the `URL`, `user`, and `password` fields -- they are required to connect to your vCenter or ESXi host.

To select which performance metrics to capture, you must define them in the `vsphere-performance.metrics` file per each `performance level` you require.
You can find this file in `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/vsphere-performance.metrics` (Linux) or `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\vsphere-performance.metrics` (Windows).
Use the flag `--perf_level` to select which level of **performance metrics** you want to capture.

Please note that the more performance metrics you enable the more load you add to your environment.

## Building

If you have downloaded the source code and installed the Go toolchain, you can build and run the vSphere integration locally.

vSphere data is obtained via a client provided by the `govmomi` package, the official Go wrapper for the VMware API. The same package provides a simulator for the virtual center, leveraged to run integration tests.

The output of the integration is determined by the `newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk` package and provided in JSON format. The [New Relic Infrastructure agent](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent) collects such data and sends it to New Relic.

1. After cloning this repository, go to the vSphere integration directory and build the integration:

    ```bash
    make compile
    ```

    The command above executes the tests for the vSphere integration and builds an executable file named `nri-vsphere` under `bin/`.

2. Run the executable with the following arguments:

    ```bash
    ./bin/darwin/nri-vsphere --url 127.0.0.1:8989/sdk --user user --pass pass --validate_ssl false
    ```

To learn more about the usage of `./bin/darwin/nri-vsphere`, pass the `-help` argument.

```bash
./bin/darwin/nri-vsphere -help
```

External dependencies are managed via `govendor`.

## Testing

After cloning this repository, go to vSphere integration directory and build the integration:

```bash
make test
```

You need `docker-compose` to run the integration tests.
